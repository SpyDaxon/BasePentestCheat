* Host command in linux using it for dns enum, host command is used to query dns.
**command** 
```bash
host -t ns *-domain-*
```
* t = type
* ns = name server 

**Automated lookup**
creating Dictionary file with bash command and loop 
with list of common subdomains (router,OWA,ftp,ssh etc.)
for the example below list.txt is the dictionary that we wrote.

```bash
for ip in $(cat list.txt) do host 
do host $ip.*.com;done 
```

**Reverse DNS BF** 
Instead of looking IP Addresses By FQDN we can search FQDN's with IP's 
* A Record - registered FQDN to ip address 
* PTR Record - registered ip address to FQDN

```bash
for ip in $(seq 155 190); do host 50.7.67.$IP; done 
```
* for = loop 
* ip = variable 
* $ = variable that is value is the result of the outcome thats what in the ()
* seq = command to generate numbers from first to last 

~ filter the results with GREP command

**DNS Zone Transfer Misconfiguration**
* Master DNS Server - containing all the Records 
* Slave DNS Server - Syncs Copies of all records from Master Server 
* AXFR - Dns Zone transfer Protocol
```bash
host -l *domainname* 
```
* l = flag for using AXFR
