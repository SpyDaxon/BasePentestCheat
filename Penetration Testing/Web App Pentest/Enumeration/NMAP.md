* nmap first recognized Host and determinate if is up or down for continue the 
	scan.
	he Does it with icmp echo request (RFC 1122) and waiting for response.
	if host is not responding it will be marked by "DOWN" and nmap will not scan it, if the host will response to this request the host status weill be "UP" and nmap will scan.
	 - in Order to Bypass It if host is blocking icmp and nmap is decided to marked this host as DOWN and is still up , USE the flag -Pn for skipping host check. 
	 ```bash
	 nmap -Pn 10.10.110.10
```

**Nmap Scripting**
for advanced scanning , nmap have scripts that can be used in any scan. 
the script is in the /usr/share/nmap/scirpts/
you can go there to see all of the list and choose the script that's fits to your scan in order to get better and additional results. 
```bash
nmap -Pn --script=/usr/share/nmap/scripts/example.nse 10.10.110.10
```

**FW Detection**
* the common *-O* flag will try to discover the operating system
```bash
nmap -O 10.10.110.10
```

* the flag *--traceroute* will trace the path to the scanned HOST 
```bash
nmap --traceroute 10.10.110.10
```

* the flag *--badsum* will causes nmap to create a bad checksum in the TCP header, all hosts should drop these packet. 
	if receive response , this means that the response comes from a firewall who didn't bother to verify checksum.
	```bash
	nmap --badsum 10.10.110.10
```

**FW/IPS Evasion**
*MTU Scanning*
by changing the bytes size of the packet you can evade port filtering or FW/IDS, 
works in 8 section ( 8,16,24 etc.)
```bash
nmap -mtu 24 10.10.110.10
```

*Decoy Addresses*
Another technique to hide our scans is by flooding the IDS with misleading data. The "-D" option in nmap allows us to specify other addresses which will work as decoys. The target system will see that he's been scanned from multiple hosts, and won't know for sure which one has initiated the probe, or which one is innocent.
```bash
nmap -D 1.1.1.1,202.20.20.20,5.5.5.5 10.10.110.10
```
* D = decoy flag

*Source Port*
By changing the source port for trusted once you can bypass FW protections 
to port like 53,80,443.
```bash
nmap --source-port 53 10.10.110.10 OR nmap -g 53 10.10.110.10
```

*Append Random Data*
by changing Data length we can harden the 'Data Packet Inspection' Mechanisem
```bash
nmap --data-length 812 10.10.110.10
```
