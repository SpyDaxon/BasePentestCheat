Enum4linux is a tool for enumerating information from Windows and Samba systems. It attempts to offer similar functionality to enum.exe formerly available fromÂ [www.bindview.com](https://www.bindview.com/).

It is written in PERL and is basically a wrapper around the Samba tools smbclient, rpclient, net and nmblookup. The samba package is therefore a dependency.

```bash
enum4linux -U -o 192.168.1.200
```
