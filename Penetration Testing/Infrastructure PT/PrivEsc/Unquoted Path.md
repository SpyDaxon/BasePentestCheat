**What is Unquoted Path**
•When a service is created whose executable path contains spaces and isn’t enclosed within quotes.
•It can lead to a vulnerability known as Unquoted Path which allows a user to gain SYSTEM privileges.
•If the service is not enclosed within quotes and is having spaces it would handle the space as a break and pass the rest of the service path as an argument.

**Example**
•We have this path: C:\Program Files\First Subfolder\Second Subfolder\Third Subfolder\Executable.exe
•In order to run Executable.exe, the system will interpret this path in the following order:
1.C:\Program.exe
2. C:\Program Files\First.exe
   3. C:\Program Files\First Subfolder\Second.exe
      4. C:\Program Files\First Subfolder\Second subfolder\Third.exe
         5. C:\Program Files\First Subfolder\Second subfolder\Third subfolder\Executable.exe

**The Exploitation Process**
•We have the write permissions in the context of the user we currently working with.
•We as an attacker can drop our malicious executable in that folder to get a reverse shell.
•We need to enumerate for a service which is vulnerable and enumerate for a write permissions in the folder as well.
