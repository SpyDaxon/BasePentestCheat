  **Recon** 
* Always search for services and their versions , search known vulnerabilities for this services.

* Always search for most vulnerable Services like SMB,FTP etc.

* Try using Default Credentials

* if port is tcpwrapped it means that the port is closing the connection after handshake because he dosent get protocol after finished handshake. 
	in order to bypass it , use a known source port and netcat.


* try to make a complex scan with nmap , using the -T falg , mtu and more in order to bypass IDS/IPS protections

	**PrivEsc**
* in Win Environment with meterpreter you might use an exploit to PriveEs 
	but after running the xploit it didn't elevate you, so you need to run getsystem command on meterpreter .
	
* In Linux Env use this command ```
	```
	cat /proc/self/environ
	```
	may contain clear text passwords as a enviorment variabel!

*  use sudo -l to list all the command that you can run as privileged without password confirmation 


	**Meterpreter Secrets**
* In *Windows Reverse shell* for using files with space between each word , you need to put the file name in "" and then it will work.
	for example:
```cmd
type "flag and more flag.txt"
```

**Persistence Shell**
Command1: export TERM=xterm 
Command2: python3 -c 'import pty;pty.spawn("/bin/bash")'  
Action: Ctrl+'Z'  
Command3: stty raw -echo ;fg
