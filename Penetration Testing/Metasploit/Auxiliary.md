  
In Metasploit auxiliary modules are special tools that help with different tasks but don't actually break into systems. Think of them as helpers for gathering information or preparing for other actions. Some Examples:

- *Scanning*: These tools look around to see what devices and services are available on a network, kind of like checking which doors and windows are open in a building.
- *Sniffing*: They listen to network traffic, capturing information that passes through, similar to overhearing conversations.
- *Password Testing*: They try lots of passwords quickly to see if they can guess the right one to get into an account or service.
- *Administration*: Once inside a system, these tools help manage it, like copying files or making changes.

Think of auxiliary modules as a Swiss Army knife for gathering information and preparing for the exploiting stage.

**Example of Usage for username Enumeration**
```bash
use auxiliary/scanner/smtp/smtp_enum
```

after that run the command - *show options*
then config the options 
for example - *set rhosts 10.10.110.10*
choose user file list in options - *set USER_FILE -pathtofile-*
and config the options for your opinion.

after finished config , use the command 
```bash
run
```

this usage will enumerate users on the Victims host on smb protocol to find 
which users you can find and they're exist.
